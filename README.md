Before running the application, make sure you've configured your database settings correctly in the application.properties file and replaced placeholder values such as the JWT secret key.

Here's a quick summary of what you should do next:

    Database Configuration: Ensure that your application.properties file contains the correct settings for your MySQL database, including the URL, username, and password.

    JWT Secret Key: Replace the placeholder value your_secret_key_here with an actual secret key in the application.properties file. You can generate a random secret key using tools like OpenSSL or online random string generators.

    Run the Application: You can now run your Spring Boot application.
